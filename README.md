I am a recent Biomedical Science graduate with a growing passion for Cybersecurity. I'm excited to bring my analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, and scientific background to the world of tech.

## Objective
Ever since I was young I've had an interest in technology and I.T as it was something that I would use on a daily basis. Alongside my journey in Biomedical science which has taught me valuable skills, it has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity. I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
